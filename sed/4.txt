<p>My wife won't let me buy a power saw. She is afraid of an
accident if I use one.
So I rely on a hand saw for a variery of weekend projects like
building shelves.
However, if I made my livingÿas a carpenter, I would
have to use a power
saw. The speed and efficiency provided by power tools
would be essential to being productive.</p>

<p>For people who create and modify text files,

can be done interactively with a text editor. However,
using these programs can save many hours of repetitive
work in achieving the same result.</p>
